[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
In my opinion, phpBB has a nicer and less confusing layout of the admin menu.  This mod attempts to make the menu closer to phpBB's menu layout without majorly rewriting SMF (also known as forking), as that would be too big a task....

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Alterations[/u][/size][/b][/color]
~ Each header has been transformed into an actual tab at the top, underneath the link tree.
~ The sidebar menu has been modified, making all areas of a particular header and all subsections of a particular area, into menu items.
~ The link tree underneath the description has been removed, as the subsections listed are now part of the sidebar.
~ "Package Manager" is now in its own section!
~ "Configuration" tab has been restored back to unmodified condition, with exception of "Security and Moderations" (see below)
~ All other modifications to "Configuration" tab were moved into a new "Mods" section
~ "Security" section has been created, using "Security and Moderations" area from "Configurations"
~ [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2155]httpBL[/url], [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2815]Forum Firewall[/url] and [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2502]Bad Behavior[/url] (if they are installed) have been moved to the "Security" section

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.8, but should work on earlier versions of SMF 2.0.x.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Other Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
The reorganization of the Admin menu takes place AFTER the processing of the hooks....
